# Mpox Severity Scoring System Integration

## Overview
The WHO Mpox Severity Scoring System (MPOX_SSS) has been fully integrated into the MPSight Flutter app, providing clinical severity assessment and care recommendations based on standardized medical guidelines.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Severity Assessment Model** (`lib/models/severity_assessment.dart`)
Comprehensive data structures for clinical assessment:

- **Severity Levels**: Mild, Moderate, Severe, Critical
- **Skin Lesion Classification**:
  - None (0 lesions)
  - Mild (<25 lesions)
  - Moderate (25-100 lesions)
  - Severe (101-250 lesions)
  - Very Severe (>250 lesions)

- **Mucosal Involvement Tracking**:
  - None
  - Mild (1 site)
  - Moderate (2 sites)
  - Severe (≥3 sites or extensive)

- **Clinical Symptoms** (24 total) organized by category:
  - **Constitutional** (5 symptoms): Fever, fatigue, myalgia, headache, lymphadenopathy
  - **Respiratory** (4 symptoms): Cough, sore throat, difficulty breathing, chest pain
  - **Gastrointestinal** (4 symptoms): Nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dehydration
  - **Neurological** (3 symptoms): Confusion, seizures, severe headache
  - **Dermatological** (4 symptoms): Secondary infection, severe pain, bleeding, necrosis
  - **Ocular** (4 symptoms): Eye pain, photophobia, vision changes, corneal lesions

### 2. **Severity Calculator** (`lib/models/severity_assessment.dart`)
Intelligent scoring algorithm:

- **Symptom Scoring**: Each symptom has weighted scores (1-5 points) based on clinical severity
- **Lesion Scoring**: Automatic scoring based on lesion count (2-8 points)
- **Mucosal Scoring**: Progressive scoring for affected sites (2-6 points)
- **Total Score Calculation**: Combined symptom, lesion, and mucosal scores
- **Severity Determination**:
  - Mild: 0-7 points
  - Moderate: 8-14 points
  - Severe: 15-24 points
  - Critical: ≥25 points OR presence of critical symptoms

- **Smart Recommendations**: Context-aware care suggestions based on:
  - Overall severity level
  - Specific symptoms present
  - Lesion distribution
  - Mucosal involvement

### 3. **Severity Provider** (`lib/providers/severity_provider.dart`)
State management for assessment workflow:

- Symptom tracking and modification
- Automatic lesion severity calculation from count
- Real-time severity recalculation
- Quick assessment from detection results
- Assessment history management

### 4. **Severity Assessment Screen** (`lib/screens/severity_assessment_screen.dart`)
Full-featured UI for clinical assessment:

**Assessment Form**:
- Lesion count input with automatic severity classification
- Mucosal involvement selection with chip buttons
- Expandable symptom categories with checkboxes
- Score preview for each symptom

**Results Display**:
- Large, color-coded severity card with total score
- Urgency indicators for hospitalization/ICU needs
- Score breakdown by category
- Detailed care recommendations list
- Medical disclaimer

**Design Features**:
- Material 3 design with color-coded severity levels:
  - Green (Mild)
  - Orange (Moderate)
  - Deep Orange (Severe)
  - Red (Critical)
- Responsive layout with cards and expansion tiles
- Emergency icons for urgent cases (⚠️, 🚨)
- Reset button for new assessments

### 5. **Quick Access Widget** (`lib/widgets/severity_quick_access.dart`)
One-tap severity assessment from detection results:

- Appears automatically when Monkeypox is detected
- Pre-fills common symptoms (fever, lymphadenopathy, myalgia)
- Estimates lesion count from image
- Quick navigation to full assessment

### 6. **Integration Points**

**Home Screen**:
- New "Severity Score" card in main action grid
- Red medical icon for high visibility
- Description: "Calculate Mpox severity"

**Camera Screen**:
- Severity quick access appears after detection
- Below confidence chart results
- Shows when Monkeypox detected

**Gallery Screen**:
- Same severity quick access placement
- Integrated with image analysis results

**Main App**:
- SeverityProvider registered in MultiProvider
- Available throughout app lifecycle

## Usage Flow

### Standard Assessment
1. User taps "Severity Score" on home screen
2. Enter estimated lesion count (auto-categorizes severity)
3. Select mucosal involvement level
4. Check applicable symptoms by category
5. Tap "Calculate Severity Score"
6. View comprehensive results and recommendations

### Quick Assessment (from Detection)
1. Upload/capture image with Monkeypox lesions
2. App detects Monkeypox condition
3. "Assess Severity" card appears
4. Tap card for pre-filled assessment
5. Adjust symptoms as needed
6. Get instant severity results

## Clinical Accuracy

### Scoring Methodology
Based on WHO guidelines and clinical severity indicators:

- **High-priority symptoms** (4-5 points):
  - Difficulty breathing
  - Confusion/altered mental status
  - Seizures
  - Vision changes/corneal lesions
  - Bleeding from lesions

- **Moderate-priority symptoms** (2-3 points):
  - Severe fatigue
  - Lymphadenopathy
  - Gastrointestinal symptoms
  - Secondary infections
  - Severe pain

- **Low-priority symptoms** (1 point):
  - Fever
  - Myalgia
  - Headache
  - Cough/sore throat

### Critical Care Triggers
Automatic recommendations for hospitalization when:
- Total score ≥15 (Severe)
- Any symptom with score ≥4 present
- Critical symptoms detected (respiratory distress, neurological changes, vision impairment)

ICU admission recommended when:
- Total score ≥25 (Critical)
- Confusion/altered mental status
- Seizures present
- Difficulty breathing

## Care Recommendations

### Mild Cases
- Home isolation and self-care
- Daily symptom monitoring
- Lesion care (clean and covered)
- Hydration and pain relief
- Avoid contact until healed

### Moderate Cases
- Contact healthcare provider
- Consider outpatient monitoring
- Pain management needed
- Watch for secondary infections
- Monitor for worsening
- Antiviral consultation

### Severe Cases
- ⚠️ SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION
- Hospital admission recommended
- Antiviral therapy (Tecovirimat)
- IV fluids if needed
- Professional wound care
- Isolation precautions

### Critical Cases

- ICU admission may be needed
- Aggressive supportive care
- Mandatory antiviral therapy
- Vital signs monitoring
- Specialist consultations

2. **Moderate case**: 75 lesions, fever, fatigue, nausea → "Moderate"
3. **Severe case**: 200 lesions, multiple symptoms, 2 mucosal sites → "Severe"
4. **Critical case**: Any respiratory distress or confusion → "Critical"

### Integration Tests
1. Monkeypox detection → Quick access appears
2. Other conditions → Quick access hidden
3. Quick assessment pre-fills symptoms correctly
4. Score calculation matches expected values
5. Recommendations match severity level
