# CHAPTER II: REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE (Revised)

## 2.1 Mpox Skin Lesion Datasets

### 2.1.1 MSLD v2.0 (Primary Dataset)

The Mpox Skin Lesion Dataset Version 2.0 (MSLD v2.0) comprises 755 original skin lesion images from 541 patients across six classes: Mpox (284 images), Chickenpox (75), Measles (55), Cowpox (66), HFMD (161), and Healthy (114). The dataset underwent two-fold verification: reverse image search for source authentication and professional dermatologist validation, making it a reliable, clinically-sound resource.

MSLD v2.0 was published in August 2024 and represents the most up-to-date mpox dataset in the literature, with all images approved by dermatologists and regulatory authorities. The dataset has 5 folders with training, validation, and test splits, plus augmented versions using rotation, translation, reflection, shear, color jitter, noise, and scaling.

The dataset reflects diverse demographics including Black, White, Latino, and Asian populations, enhancing its applicability across different ethnic groups. This diversity is critical for developing models that generalize across populations and address potential algorithmic biases.

### 2.1.2 Supplementary Datasets

Researchers have utilized MSLD v2.0 in combination with the Monkeypox Skin Images Dataset (MSID) from Mendeley Data v6 and the Mpox Close Skin Images (MCSI) dataset from NIAID Data Ecosystem for cross-dataset validation. The MCSI dataset comprises 228 high-resolution smartphone-acquired images (102 Mpox-positive, 126 non-Mpox) representing real-world teledermatology scenarios, with negative samples including Chickenpox, Measles, Eczema, and other visually similar lesions.

## 2.2 Deep Learning Architectures for Mpox Detection

### 2.2.1 Transformer-Based Approaches

Recent research employed Vision Transformer (ViT), Masked Autoencoder (MAE), DINO, and SwinTransformer architectures for mpox classification, demonstrating superior performance compared to CNN-based models through their attention mechanisms and multilayer architectures suited for analyzing complex visual presentations of skin lesions.

A study using modified ViT achieved 93.03% accuracy in detecting mpox lesions from MSLD v2.0, with precision, recall, and F1-score above 92% and AUC of 94.33%, significantly exceeding previous CNN-based approaches. An ensemble model combining ViT and ConvMixer improved diagnostic performance by integrating global pattern recognition capabilities with fine-grained feature extraction.

### 2.2.2 Convolutional Neural Networks

The SkinMarkNet framework employed an ensemble of three transfer learning models (Inception, Xception, ResNet) for feature extraction, utilizing data augmentation to address annotated data scarcity and improve model generalization.

Ali et al. (2023) achieved 82.26% accuracy using DenseNet121 architecture with HAM10000 pre-trained weights, while Biswas et al. achieved 95.05% accuracy for binary classification (mpox vs. non-mpox) and 85.78% for six-class classification using DarkNet53 architecture.

### 2.2.3 Few-Shot Learning Approaches

Prototypical Networks combined with NASNetMobile and ResNet50V2 achieved outstanding accuracy (99.97%, 99.13%, 98.33%) on MSLD, MSID, and MSCI datasets, proving effective for low-data scenarios by creating representative prototypes that support generalization.

FOSSIL (Flexible Optimization via Sample-Sensitive Importance Learning), a regret-minimizing weighting framework using softmax-based uncertainty as a difficulty measure, achieved AUC of 0.9573 and calibration ECE of 0.053, substantially improving discrimination and robustness without metadata or synthetic augmentation.

## 2.3 Lesion Segmentation and Analysis

Traditional mpox detection studies focused on classification without pixel-level lesion delineation. Semantic segmentation enables precise lesion boundary identification, critical for:
- Accurate lesion counting (resolving inter-rater variability of 30-60%)
- Confluence detection (identifying merged lesions)
- Distribution mapping (regional severity assessment)
- Temporal progression tracking

U-Net architecture with attention mechanisms has proven effective for medical image segmentation, achieving Dice coefficients >0.85 for various dermatological conditions. No published studies have applied semantic segmentation specifically to mpox lesions in MSLD v2.0, representing a research gap this study addresses.

## 2.4 Severity Scoring Systems

### 2.4.1 MPOX-SSS Framework

The Mpox Severity Scoring System (MPOX-SSS) provides standardized severity assessment based on: (1) total lesion count, (2) regional distribution, (3) lesion confluence, (4) mucosal involvement, (5) secondary bacterial infection, (6) systemic complications. Scores range 0-18+, categorized as mild (0-5), moderate (6-12), severe (>12).

Current MPOX-SSS implementation relies on manual clinical assessment with significant inter-rater variability (Cohen's kappa 0.4-0.6). Automated scoring using AI has not been previously attempted, presenting an opportunity for objective, reproducible severity quantification.

### 2.4.2 Dermatologist Ground Truth

Clinical validation requires dermatologist expertise as ground truth. In MSLD v2.0, a professional dermatologist played a crucial role in the verification process, ensuring image authenticity and diagnostic accuracy. For severity scoring, consensus ratings from multiple dermatologists (≥3) reduce individual bias and establish reliable benchmarks for model training and validation.

## 2.5 Fitzpatrick Skin Type and Algorithmic Bias

### 2.5.1 Representation Disparities

Medical AI systems demonstrate performance disparities across racial and ethnic groups, often due to training dataset imbalance. Darker skin types (Fitzpatrick IV-VI) are historically underrepresented in dermatological datasets, leading to reduced diagnostic accuracy for these populations.

Studies show accuracy gaps of 10-20% between Fitzpatrick Type I-II (light skin) and Type V-VI (dark skin) for AI dermatology systems trained on predominantly Caucasian datasets. Addressing this bias requires:
- Balanced representation across all Fitzpatrick types
- Skin type-stratified evaluation
- Targeted data augmentation for underrepresented groups
- Fairness-aware loss functions

### 2.5.2 Philippine Demographic Context

The Philippine population predominantly presents Fitzpatrick Types III-V (Southeast Asian brown skin). A case report demonstrated mpox presentation on Southeast Asian brown skin, highlighting distinct visual characteristics compared to presentations on lighter skin types documented in Western literature. Local dataset collection ensures model generalization to the target population.

## 2.6 Multimodal Medical AI Systems

### 2.6.1 Visual + Clinical Data Integration

Multimodal systems combining images with clinical metadata improve diagnostic accuracy by 5-15% compared to image-only models. Effective fusion strategies include:
- **Early Fusion**: Concatenate features before model processing
- **Late Fusion**: Combine predictions from separate modality-specific models
- **Attention-Based Fusion**: Learn optimal feature weighting across modalities

For mpox diagnosis, relevant non-visual features include fever (present in 62% of cases), lymphadenopathy (58%), headache (51%), and exposure history—information not captured in images alone.

### 2.6.2 Natural Language Processing for Clinical Notes

Clinical text notes contain valuable diagnostic context (onset timing, progression description, contact history). Transformer-based NLP models (BioClinicalBERT, PubMedBERT) extract structured information from unstructured text, enabling integration with visual features for comprehensive assessment.

## 2.7 Privacy-Preserving Medical AI

### 2.7.1 On-Device Inference

Patient data privacy is paramount in medical applications. The Philippine Data Privacy Act of 2012 and international regulations (HIPAA, GDPR) require strict confidentiality measures. On-device inference eliminates server transmission of patient images, reducing privacy risks while enabling offline operation in connectivity-limited areas.

TensorFlow Lite with INT8 quantization enables deployment of complex models (<20MB) on smartphones with acceptable latency (<3s) and minimal accuracy degradation (<3%).

### 2.7.2 Federated Learning Potential

Future iterations could employ federated learning, allowing model improvement across multiple institutions without centralizing patient data. Local model updates aggregate to improve global model performance while maintaining data sovereignty.

## 2.8 Philippine Context and Local Studies

The first confirmed mpox case in the Philippines occurred in July 2022 in a traveler returning from Europe, belonging to Clade IIb associated with the global outbreak. The case presented with atypical features: fewer than 10 lesions with oral and anogenital involvement.

Local healthcare challenges include limited laboratory capacity (only 12% of surveyed facilities capable of orthopoxvirus detection), geographic barriers to specialist consultation, and healthcare worker training gaps. AI-based screening tools address these challenges by democratizing diagnostic capabilities.
