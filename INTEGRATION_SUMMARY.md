# Model Integration Summary

## ✅ System Ready for Model Integration

Your MPSight app is now properly configured to receive and use your trained model. Here's what has been set up:

---

## What's Been Done

### 1. ✅ Model Configuration
- **Location:** `assets/models/mpox_classifier.tflite`
- **Status:** Placeholder file (67 bytes) - **Ready to be replaced**
- **Expected classes:** 6 (MSLD v2.0 dataset)
- **Input shape:** [1, 640, 640, 3] (Float32, RGB, normalized 0-1)
- **Output shape:** [1, 6] (Float32, confidence scores)

### 2. ✅ Detection Provider
- **File:** `lib/providers/detection_provider.dart`
- **Configuration:** 
  - Model path: `assets/models/mpox_classifier.tflite`
  - Classes: Chickenpox, Cowpox, Healthy, HFMD, Measles, Monkeypox
  - Optimization: 4 threads, NNAPI enabled
  - Enhanced logging for debugging

### 3. ✅ Flutter Project
- **Dependencies:** All installed and working
- **Assets:** Model directory properly configured in `pubspec.yaml`
- **Build:** Project compiles successfully

### 4. ✅ Documentation
- **MODEL_INTEGRATION.md** - Complete integration guide
- **assets/models/README.md** - Model specifications and requirements
- **place_model.ps1** - Interactive helper script
- **convert_to_tflite.py** - PyTorch to TFLite conversion script

---

## How to Integrate Your Model

### Option 1: Using the Helper Script (Easiest) ⭐

```powershell
.\place_model.ps1
```

This interactive script will:
- Check current model status
- Help you copy your .tflite file
- Backup existing model
- Verify integration

### Option 2: Manual Copy (Quick)

```powershell
# Replace the placeholder with your model
copy your_trained_model.tflite assets\models\mpox_classifier.tflite

# Clean and rebuild
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Option 3: Convert from PyTorch (If you have .pt file)

1. Edit `convert_to_tflite.py` line 28:
   ```python
   model_path = r"C:\path\to\your\best.pt"
   ```

2. Run conversion:
   ```powershell
   python convert_to_tflite.py
   ```

---

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check File Placement
```powershell
Get-Item assets\models\mpox_classifier.tflite | Select-Object Length
```
**Expected:** > 1MB (typically 5-20MB)

### 2. Run the App
```powershell
flutter run
```

### 3. Look for Success Messages
In the debug console, you should see:
```
📊 Model Input Shape: [1, 640, 640, 3]
📊 Model Output Shape: [1, 6]
📊 Model Classes: [Chickenpox, Cowpox, Healthy, HFMD, Measles, Monkeypox]
✅ Model loaded successfully and ready for detection
```

### 4. Test Detection
1. Launch app
2. Tap "Capture Photo" or "Gallery"
3. Select/capture an image
4. Check console for detection logs:
   ```
   🔍 detectSkinCondition called
   📸 Decoding image...
   🖼️ Resizing image to 640x640...
   🤖 Running inference...
   🎯 Primary condition: Monkeypox (85.3%)
   ```

## Important Notes

### ⚠️ Current Status
- **Model file is currently a PLACEHOLDER (67 bytes)**
- **You need to replace it with your actual trained model**
- **The app will run in mock mode until a real model is placed**

### ✅ Ready When You Are
- All configuration is complete
- Just drop your model file and run!
- No code changes needed (unless your model has different specs)

### 🔧 If Your Model Differs
If your trained model has different specifications:

**Different class count:**
- Update `_labels` list in `lib/providers/detection_provider.dart`

**Different input size:**
- Update resize dimensions in `detection_provider.dart`
- Update input tensor shape

**Different class order:**
- Reorder `_labels` list to match your training order

## Next Steps

1. **Locate your trained model file** (.tflite format)

2. **Run the helper script:**
   ```powershell
   .\place_model.ps1
   ```
   OR copy manually:
   ```powershell
   copy your_model.tflite assets\models\mpox_classifier.tflite
   ```

3. **Clean and build:**
