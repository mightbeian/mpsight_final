# CHAPTER III: RESEARCH METHODOLOGY (Comprehensive Revision)

## 3.1 Research Design

This study employs a **mixed-methods developmental research design** combining:
1. **Quantitative analysis**: Model performance metrics, statistical validation
2. **Qualitative analysis**: Clinical usability assessment, expert feedback
3. **Experimental validation**: Prospective clinical testing in Philippine healthcare settings

The research follows an **Agile iterative development methodology** with continuous integration of clinical feedback, enabling adaptive improvement of system components based on stakeholder input.

## 3.2 Dataset Acquisition and Preparation

### 3.2.1 Primary Dataset: MSLD v2.0

**Source**: Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joydippaul/mpox-skin-lesion-dataset-version-20-msld-v20/data

**Characteristics**:
- 755 original images from 541 patients
- 6 classes: Mpox (284), Chickenpox (75), Measles (55), Cowpox (66), HFMD (161), Healthy (114)
- Dermatologist-verified via two-fold validation process
- 5-fold cross-validation splits pre-configured
- Augmented versions provided (rotation, translation, reflection, shear, color jitter)

**Dataset Limitations Addressed**:
1. **Missing Lesion Type Labels**: Research team will re-annotate 400-500 images with lesion stage labels (macular, papular, vesicular, pustular, crusted) verified by ≥2 dermatologists
2. **No Segmentation Masks**: Semi-automated annotation using CVAT + SAM (Segment Anything Model) with dermatologist refinement
3. **No Severity Scores**: Clinical team assigns MPOX-SSS scores based on visible lesions and documented clinical parameters

### 3.2.3 Data Annotation Pipeline

**Phase 1: Lesion Type Annotation** (Months 2-3)
1. Select 400-500 representative images from MSLD v2.0
2. Clinical team annotates each image with:
   - Lesion stage classification (macular/papular/vesicular/pustular/crusted)
   - Bounding boxes for each lesion
   - Confidence level (high/medium/low)
3. Independent verification by ≥2 dermatologists
4. Consensus resolution for disagreements
5. Quality control: 10% re-annotation by third expert

**Phase 2: Segmentation Mask Generation** (Months 3-4)
1. Semi-automated segmentation using SAM (Segment Anything Model)
2. Manual refinement in CVAT annotation tool
3. Quality metrics: Edge smoothness, boundary precision
4. Dermatologist validation of mask accuracy
5. Inter-annotator agreement: Target Dice coefficient ≥0.90

**Phase 3: Severity Score Assignment** (Months 4-5)
1. Dermatologist panel (n=3) independently assigns MPOX-SSS scores
2. Components assessed:
   - Total lesion count (from segmentation masks)
   - Regional distribution (head/neck, trunk, extremities, genitals)
   - Confluence (based on mask overlap analysis)
   - Mucosal involvement (if documented in metadata)
3. Consensus scoring: Majority vote or median value
4. Inter-rater reliability: Calculate Cohen's kappa (target ≥0.70)

**Phase 4: Fitzpatrick Classification** (Month 5)

### 3.2.4 Data Splitting Strategy

**Training Set** (70%): ~528 images
- Used for model training and parameter optimization
- Stratified by class to maintain distribution
- Augmentation applied during training

**Validation Set** (15%): ~113 images
- Hyperparameter tuning and model selection
- No augmentation applied
- Used for early stopping criterion

**Test Set** (15%): ~114 images
- Final performance evaluation
- Completely held out, never seen during training
- Stratified by class and Fitzpatrick type
- No augmentation

**5-Fold Cross-Validation**:
- Utilized for robust performance estimation
- Reduces variance in performance metrics
- Enables ensemble model development

### 3.2.5 Data Augmentation Techniques

**Spatial Augmentations**:

- Contrast: ±25%
- Saturation: ±20%
- Hue shift: ±15 degrees
- Color jitter: Simulate different lighting conditions

**Clinical Augmentations**:
- Gaussian noise: Simulate low-quality cameras (σ=0.01-0.05)
- Motion blur: Simulate camera shake (kernel 3x3-7x7)
- JPEG compression: Simulate compressed teledermatology images (quality 60-95)
- Random shadows: Simulate natural/artificial lighting variations

**Advanced Augmentations**:

- AugMix: Compositional augmentation for robustness

### 3.2.6 Class Imbalance Mitigation

**Problem**: Mpox (284) >> Measles (55), creating biased learning

**Solutions**:
1. **Weighted Loss Functions**:
   - Class weights inversely proportional to frequency
   - Focal loss (γ=2.0) emphasizing hard examples

2. **Oversampling Minority Classes**:
   - SMOTE-like augmentation for Measles, Chickenpox
   - Target balanced distribution in training batches

3. **Two-Stage Training**:
   - Stage 1: Train on balanced subset
   - Stage 2: Fine-tune on full dataset with weights
