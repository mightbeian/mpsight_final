## 🎯 What Changed? (Quick Summary)

### From This (v1.0):
```
Simple 6-class classifier
↓
Image → CNN → Probabilities → Chart
```

### To This (v2.0):

## 📊 Dataset: MSLD v2.0

**Download here**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joydippaul/mpox-skin-lesion-dataset-version-20-msld-v20/data

**What you get**:
- 755 images from 541 patients
- 6 classes (dermatologist-verified)
- 5-fold cross-validation splits
- Augmented versions included

**What you need to add** (for full system):
1. Lesion type annotations (400-500 images) - requires dermatologist panel
2. Segmentation masks - semi-automated with SAM + manual refinement
3. MPOX-SSS scores - dermatologist consensus scoring
4. Fitzpatrick classification - computational + expert review

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Do I need to implement everything immediately?**
A: No! Follow the phased timeline in Chapter 3. Start with dataset preparation and basic models.

**Q: What if I can't get dermatologist panel right away?**
A: Use publicly available annotations initially. Plan to enhance with expert ratings later for clinical validation.

**Q: Is the Flutter app ready to use?**
A: The base implementation is there (v1.0 features). You'll need to add the new modules (segmentation, severity scoring, etc.) as you develop them.

**Q: Where's the model training code?**
A: Not uploaded yet - you'll create this following the architecture in Chapter 3. The thesis files provide the complete specification.

**Q: Can I start with just multi-class classification?**
A: Yes! Implement components incrementally:
1. Multi-class (6 diseases) - easiest
2. Lesion detection (YOLOv8) - moderate
3. Segmentation (U-Net) - moderate
4. Severity + Multimodal - advanced
