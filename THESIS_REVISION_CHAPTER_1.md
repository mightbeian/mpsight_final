# CHAPTER I: INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 PROJECT CONTEXT

Infectious diseases continue to challenge global health systems, with emerging viral infections like mpox (formerly monkeypox) requiring rapid, accurate diagnosis and severity assessment to prevent transmission and ensure appropriate treatment. The 2022 mpox outbreak, declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization, affected over 98,000 cases across more than 100 countries, with 94,623 cases occurring in historically non-endemic regions. The Philippines reported its first confirmed case on July 26, 2022—a travel-related infection from the B.1.3 lineage of Clade IIb associated with the European outbreak.

Traditional diagnostic approaches rely heavily on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, which faces significant limitations including false negative rates up to 40%, high costs, limited availability in resource-constrained settings, and delays in result delivery. Visual diagnosis by dermatologists remains challenging due to mpox's high visual similarity to other exanthematous diseases including chickenpox, measles, cowpox, and hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD). In the Philippines, the archipelagic geography and uneven distribution of healthcare resources create substantial barriers to timely diagnosis, with many facilities lacking access to dermatological specialists and laboratory diagnostic capabilities.

The emergence of computer vision, deep learning, and multimodal artificial intelligence has created unprecedented opportunities for comprehensive medical diagnostic systems. Recent advances in transformer-based architectures, semantic segmentation networks, and multimodal fusion techniques offer the potential to augment clinical expertise, standardize severity assessment, and improve healthcare accessibility—particularly critical in resource-limited environments where specialist consultation and laboratory testing are unavailable or delayed.

## 1.2 PURPOSE AND DESCRIPTION

MPSight is a comprehensive, multi-modal artificial intelligence system designed for mpox detection, lesion characterization, and severity assessment. The system integrates multiple advanced AI components to provide clinicians with detailed diagnostic support:
